# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
Cari Jung • DH110 • Fall 2022

## Description of Project
#### Purpose of Low-fidelity Prototype
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to test the features of UN Environment Programme and analyze whether users achieve their goal the "right" way (whether they do what we expect them to do).

#### User Research
The UN Environment Programme site is a global site and therefore attracts people from all over the world. Hence, the interface and flow of this website sould be designed so that it can cater to the wide demographic of users. By conducting a user research, I was able to find that it is difficult to look for specific resources and ways they could get involved to ameliorate the pressing environmental issues. Therefore, my purpose is to enhanve features that seme to be hidden away. 

Explore the user research process [here](https://github.com/carijung/DH110-UserResearch/blob/main/README.md). 

#### Persona and Usage Scenario
I created three personas and scenarios each focusing on the different purposes of using the website. 
 * Persona and Scenario 1: A college student with high technical skills, Taehyun, from South Korea strives to create a personalized data based on the topics he wants to explore. 
 * Persona and Scenario 2: A recreation manager with mediocre technical skills named Olivia, aged 52, strives to organize activities for her community to advance our   progress towards achieving sustainability goals. 
 * Persona and Scenario 3: An architect with higher technical skills than Olivia, but little bit less than Taehyun, named Daphney, aged 28, strives to gain insight on what is being accomplished in Africa and wants to find more information on UN's goals on ameliorating housing insecurity.

#### Tasks
1. Create a personalized data based on sustainbaility topics and country/region(s).
2. Find ways to get involved with works related to the environment.
3. Find information about each sustainable goal.

### Notes taken during prototype testing 
> What caused confusion
>    * 'Explore' button on "Sustainable Development Goals" page almost misled user into thinking they would be able to find specific information about the sustainability goals


> What went smooth
>    * Instructions were clear and user knew how to download data and what type of file to expect
>    * The arrow in the navigation bar helped user to expect a drop down menu 
>    * User knew what was clickable 


## Reflection
Creating wireframes via FIGMA was a enjoyable process that helped me hone my wireframing and wireflow skills. It was exciting to present my wireframes to the user and see how they interacted with my finalized low-fidelity prototype. Adding a new navigation tab specifically for ways users can get involved helped them find all the events, campaigns, and other opportunities under one tab. Moreover, options such as the "go back" button made it easier for the user to navigate to the first page of every submenu they initially selected. Based on the low-fidelity testing, I would implement a more specific text into clickable features so users know what to expect when they click a button or have the choice to not click that button at all if they think it's irrelevant to their usage purpose. In this project, after every task, I automatically navigated the users to the homepage by adding a wireframe of the home page to every task section. For my future project, instead of adding the wireframe of the homepage to every task, I'd like to see how the user navigates from task 1 to task 2 without going back to the home page.
